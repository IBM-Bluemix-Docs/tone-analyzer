## High availability
{: #high-availability}

The {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service is highly available with no single point of failure within any {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} location (for example, Dallas or Washington, DC). The service achieves high availability automatically and transparently by means of the multi-zone region (MZR) feature provided by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} enables multiple zones that do not share a single point of failure within a single location. It also provides automatic load balancing across the zones within a region.

## Disaster recovery
{: #disaster-recovery}

The {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service is stateless. It stores no user data on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. In the event of a catastrophic failure in a region, complete the following steps:

1.  Create a new instance of the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service in a different region.
1.  Modify your application to use the URL and credentials for the new service instance.
