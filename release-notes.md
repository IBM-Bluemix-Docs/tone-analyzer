### 30 October 2018
{: #October2018}

**Service version** - `3.5.4`<br/> **Interface version** - `2017-09-21`

The {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service has migrated to token-based IAM authentication for all locations. All {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services now use IAM authentication. The {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service migrated in each location on the following dates:

-   Dallas (**us-south**): October 30, 2018
-   Frankfurt (**eu-de**): In progress
-   Washington, DC (**us-east**): June 11, 2018
-   Sydney (**au-syd**): May 25, 2018

The service continues to use Cloud Foundry service credentials for authentication in the Frankfurt location. This location will migrate to IAM authentication as soon as possible.
{: important}

The migration to IAM authentication affects new and existing service instances differently:

-   *All new service instances that you create in any location* now use IAM authentication to access the service. You can pass either a bearer token or an API key: Tokens support authenticated requests without embedding service credentials in every call; API keys use HTTP basic authentication. When you use any of the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} SDKs, you can pass the API key and let the SDK manage the lifecycle of the tokens.
-   *Existing service instances that you created in a location before the indicated migration date*  continue to use the `{username}` and `{password}` from their previous Cloud Foundry service credentials for authentication until you update them to use IAM authentication. Because the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service is stateless, you can perform the following steps to convert an existing service instance to use IAM authentication:

    1.  Delete and re-create the service instance.
    1.  Modify your application code to use IAM authentication.

For more information, see the following documentation:

-   To learn which authentication mechanism your service instance uses, view your service credentials by clicking the instance on the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/dashboard/apps){: new_window}.
-   For more information about using IAM tokens with Watson services, see [Authenticating with IAM tokens](/docs/services/watson/getting-started-iam.html).
-   For more information about using IAM API keys with Watson services, see [IAM service API keys](/docs/services/watson/apikey-bp.html).
-   For examples that use IAM authentication, see the [API reference ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/tone-analyzer){: new_window}.

### 11 June 2018
{: #June2018}

**Service version** - `3.5.4`<br/> **Interface version** - `2017-09-21`

For service instances and applications that are hosted in Washington, DC (**us east**), the service now supports a new API authentication process. For more information, see the [30 October 2018 service update](#October2018).

### 25 May 2018
{: #May2018}

**Service version** - `3.5.4`<br/> **Interface version** - `2017-09-21`

For service instances and applications that are hosted in Sydney (**au-syd**), the service now supports a new API authentication process. For more information, see the [30 October 2018 service update](#October2018).

### 13 March 2018
{: #March2018}

**Service version** - `3.5.3`<br/> **Interface version** - `2017-09-21`

The service was updated to add French (`fr`) input content in addition to English for the customer-engagement endpoint, `/v3/tone_chat`. You use the `Content-Language` request header to specify a language; the default is US English.

### 28 September 2017
{: #September2017b}

**Service version** - `3.4.1`<br/> **Interface version** - `2017-09-21`

The throttling limit on the maximum number of requests that an individual {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} username can submit increased to 1200 requests per minute. The service returns HTTP response code 429 *Too many requests* if a user exceeds that limit.

### 25 September 2017
{: #September2017a}

**Service version** - `3.4.1`<br/> **Interface version** - `2017-09-21`

-   The general-purpose endpoint (the `/v3/tone` method) changed.

    -   Supports French (`fr`) input content in addition to English.
    -   No longer returns social tones.
    -   No longer returns `disgust` with the emotion tones.
    -   Omits any tone whose score is less than `0.5`. This qualification matches the response of the `/v3/tone_chat` method.
    - No longer returns tone categories (the `tone_categories` field) as part of its output. All tones whose values meet the qualifying threshold are returned as part of a single `tones` object. As before, tones are always returned for the full document and for each individual sentence by default.
    - No longer accepts a `tones` query parameter to limit the output to specified tones. All qualifying tones are returned for every request. Including the parameter with a request does not cause an error, but it has no effect on the response.
    - No longer returns `input_from` and `input_to` fields for individual sentences. In addition to the results of its analysis, the method now returns only an ID and the text of each sentence.

-   The service now returns HTTP response code 200 instead of 400 for partially correct input in the following cases:

    -   For the `/v3/tone` method, if you submit more than 128 KB or 1000 sentences of input content, the service returns a `warning` field as part of its response. The service analyzes the first 1000 sentences for document-level analysis. It analyzes only the first 100 sentences for sentence-level analysis. Earlier versions of the service returned response code 400 for the request if you exceeded either limit. Also, the service now analyzes sentences that have fewer than three words.
    -   For the `/v3/tone_chat` method, if you submit more than 50 utterances, the service returns a `warning` field for the overall content at the `utterances_tone` level of the response; it analyzes only the first 50 utterances. If you submit a single utterance that contains more than 500 characters, the service returns an `error` field for that utterance and does not analyze the utterance. Earlier versions of the service returned response code 400 if you exceeded either limit. If all utterances of the input have more than 500 characters, the service still returns response code 400 for the request.

-   The service now throttles the number of requests that it accepts from a single user. The service returns HTTP response code 429 *Too many requests* if it receives more than 600 requests per minute from an individual {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} username.

-   The following changes apply to both the general-purpose and customer-engagement endpoints:

    -   The interface version that is specified with the `version` parameter is `2017-09-21` to use the latest version of the service.
    -   The documentation was updated to note that the service can produce localized output in various languages. Use the `Accept-Language` request header to specify the language.

### 6 July 2017
{: #July2017b}

**Service version** - `3.3.6`<br/> **Interface version** - `2016-05-19`

The service was updated for a small defect fix to the customer-engagement endpoint.

### 1 July 2017
{: #July2017a}

**Service version** - `3.3.5`<br/> **Interface version** - `2016-05-19`

The customer-engagement endpoint of the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service is now generally available (GA). All calls to the endpoint are now charged at the same rate as calls to the general-purpose endpoint.

### 8 May 2017
{: #May2017}

**Service version** - `3.3.4`<br/> **Interface version** - `2016-05-19`

IBM updated the emotion tone and customer-care engagement tone score models by further expanding the training data set. The models now have greater precision on the benchmark data set.

### 17 April 2017
{: #April2017}

-   A new set of tones specific to the customer-engagement domain is now available: *frustrated*, *satisfied*, *excited*, *polite*, *impolite*, *sad*, and *sympathetic*. The service detects these tones from the text of a conversation between a customer and an agent. The tones are currently beta functionality.
-   IBM released updates to the emotion tone score model that improve the emotion results.

### 15 March 2017
{: #March2017}

IBM updated the emotion tone score model. The training data set was expanded. As a result, the models now have greater precision on the benchmark data set.

### 1 December 2016
{: #December2016}

IBM updated the document emotion tone scores. The new model considers the emotion profile of sentences to aggregate the document score.

### 18 October 2016
{: #October2016b}

IBM enhanced the social tone. The service now uses an open-source word-embedding technique that is called [GloVe ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/){: new_window} to infer social tone scores. This change allows the service to cover a larger vocabulary of words when it calculates social tones. For more information about how social tones are inferred, see [The science behind the service](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/personality-insights/science.html) for the {{site.data.keyword.personalityinsightsshort}} service.

### 3 October 2016
{: #October2016a}

IBM enhanced sentence-level emotion detection. The service uses new training data, a new feature-selection process, and augmented lexicons for words, emojis, and slang. These changes produce different but significantly improved emotion scores at the sentence level. The service's API did not change.

### 19 May 2016
{: #May2016}

The generally available (GA) release of the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service includes these new features:

-   The service's models use improved context sensitivity to interpret tone. The models now use more than lexical tokens. They now consider features such as punctuation, emoticons, language parameters such as sentence structure, and sentence complexity.
-   The writing tone model was renamed to language tone.
-   The language and emotion tone models now handle negations.
-   The service no longer returns a response for sentences with fewer than three words.
-   The service now has a simplified and improved [demo ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://tone-analyzer-demo.ng.bluemix.net){: new_window}.
